/* TODO Code Review Interface General Notes
- Stringview vs String. This may not be correct, as Mike noted.
- Documentation could have been more informative to clarify the design and context.
- There are not enough comments and documentation to understand the decision-making
process behind this design choice. Although the design is clear, more expressive
documentation could help reviewers and developers understand the code functionality
and context better.

/* GameContainer
    - What it's For:
    This Game Container is a Stub for the future Real GameContainer which will support playing an actual game.
    This stub helps to test that the serverProcessors can send data objects to, and recieve data objects from a Game Container.
    - How to Use:
    Whenever a GameContainer needs to be pinged, a Data Object should be passed into the game containers process(dataObject) parameter.
    The return value of the function should be a DataObject as well.

/* TODO: Design is Too Specific
    which seems to make it hard to extend and add more functionalities later. For example,
    the design is just handling the roles of players and owners for now, and it may need to
    add more independent objects and methods for other roles such as audiences. What if
    an owner or an audience wants to become a player in the middle of gameplay? There
    arenâ€™t any clear patterns that can support this functionality easily. It may be worth
    considering applying polymorphism in this design. Some other design patterns could
    also be a helpful addition to the refactoring process of this design because the current
    solution may make things difficult to refactor
