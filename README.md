## Git Development 
### Git Setup
Make sure to 
- `git config user.name sfu_id`  
- `git config user.email sfu_id@sfu.ca`  
check that you have configured properly with `git config --list`

### Git Branches 
No development should be done directy on the master branch. 
Make a branch, push it to origin, then do a pull request.

After any pull request, do NOT delete the branch! They are needed to calculate code contribution.

### Git Commits 
Try to make every Commit an isolated work item. If you fix a bug in candy.cpp, and added a new test to the get_username() function, these should be in two different commits. 

In every commit message, provide a brief overview of the changes you made, and credit any contributors to that commit. For example, a commit message might look like: 
'Added unit tests for get_username(). Authors: Andy and Mike'
